Vulnerability and misconfiguration scanner for Linux written in Bash.

**How it works**

The script looks for misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, checks the log files for any suspicious activities and offers remediation steps and suggestions.

It scans Linux based systems using built-in commands, making the script fast and portable. 

Needs elevated privileges in order to get the full system scan.
